<h2><Strong>Features unsolved:</strong></h2>

<li>The login functionality in the site does not provide the ability for user to delete registered account, as users can only create account</li>

<h2><Strong>Database:</strong></h2>

<li>A postgreSQL database offered by elephantSQL was the choice of database connected with the django framework during project development.</li>
<li>The database was designed to allow CRUD functionality to be available to registered users, when signed in. The user model is the main application as it is connected the main comment and post, linked by primary/foreign key relationships.</li>

<li>The comment model holds objects that are linked to the comment Models by a many to many relationship. This allows users to create comment or testimony to others.</li>

<li>Written testimony or comments by a Foreign Key which allows the users to be able to view and update testimony after registration.</li>


<h2><Strong>Security:</strong></h2>
<li>The admin path was changed from the conventional name admin</li>
<li>The website as a secure HTTP to prevent cyber attacks during data sharing.</li>
<li>Environment variables were stored in an env.py for local development for security purposes to ensure no secret keys, api keys or sensitive information was added the repository. In production, these variables were added to the heroku config vars within the project.</li>
<li>Django has a security line code written 'CSRF' for forms in this website to prevent malicious cyber attacks or otherwise.</li>
<li>The Debug is set to false before production.</li>
