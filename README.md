<h2><Strong>Agile Planning:</strong></h2>
<li>This project was developed using agile methodologies</li>

<li>All tasks were assigned to epics, prioritized under the Todo, Progress and Done.</li>

<li>They were assigned to carry along as the project is progressing and stories allocated accordingly to the complexity. "Todo" stories is where I have listed the 'to do' stories lines, and "In progress" is where I have on-going work work in the tast mangement listed, likewise 'Done list', where I have the task completed.

<li>The Kanban board was created using github projects, the image can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. All stories except the documentation tasks have a full set of acceptance criteria in order to define the functionality that marks that story as complete.</li>
  
<li>It was done this way to ensure that all core requirements were completed first to give the project a complete sense of work.</li>

<h2><Strong>Features unsolved:</strong></h2>

<li>The login functionality in the site does not provide the ability for user to delete registered account, as users can only create account and also displaying a successful logout from the account was unsolved</li>

<h2><Strong>Database:</strong></h2>

<li>A postgreSQL database offered by elephantSQL was the choice of database connected with the django framework during project development.</li>
<li>The database was designed to allow CRUD functionality to be available to registered users, when signed in. The user model is the main application as it is connected the main comment and post, linked by primary/foreign key relationships.</li>

<li>The comment model holds objects that are linked to the comment Models by a many to many relationship. This allows users to create comment or testimony to others.</li>

<li>Written testimony or comments by a Foreign Key which allows the users to be able to view and update testimony after registration.</li>


<h2><Strong>Security:</strong></h2>
<li>The admin path was changed from the conventional name admin</li>
<li>The website as a secure HTTP to prevent cyber attacks during data sharing.</li>
<li>Environment variables were stored in an env.py for local development for security purposes to ensure no secret keys, api keys or sensitive information was added the repository. In production, these variables were added to the heroku config vars within the project.</li>
<li>Django has a security line code written 'CSRF' for forms in this website to prevent malicious cyber attacks or otherwise.</li>
<li>The Debug is set to false before production.</li>


<h2><Strong>Testing:</strong></h2>
<li>The manual testing of the site was rendering as expected. Each section of the site was tested and no errors were found.</li>
<li>From the view page, the navbar was working as expected and I was able to navigate to the preferred section as expected on the about page, contact page,home page, the external links for the social media and the internal navigation for the login ,register and logout navbar.</li>
<li>In the body of the site, there is a created post and date and when a user want to read about the post, I tested the read more to confirm the navigation of the read more of the post which the navigation of the read more worked as expected and the full details of the post was open</li>

<li>The testing of the footer features in the read more section, I discovered that not all three of them were working as expected but I had to rethink to know why it was so, and I discovered that one of the page was linking directly to the page with full UrL instead of the main body of the post, which was corrected.</li>

<li>I also tested the crud functionality. Unregister users can not add comment, rather the user will be ask to register to add comment, which was expected and registered users can read,create, update and delete their comment or testimonies and these functions are working as expected, having tested the functionalities.</li>
<li>I tested the admin panel for registered users and also to delete posts and these functions are working as expected</li>

<li>I also tested the 'waitlist field of the site, users showing interest in our Yoga training by adding their email addresses into the 'waitlist field, to join the waiting list of the Yoga training, and having done their registration of account and to register their email addresses in the wait list field. I tested the peice of function and it was showing the registered email addresses by users on the data base as expected, which was very nice to see</li>

<h2><Strong>My Challange:</strong></h2><br>
<li>The waiting list field section of the site was a challange. To see a registered user email address on the database,was challanging at first but it was later solved and I was able to see users email addresses on the database, which makes me very happy</li><br>
